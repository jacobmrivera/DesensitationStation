# PROTOTYPE NOTES:

### Show and Tell 1
- **first iteration:**
	- nix user video upload and have one standard video sample that users can customize
	- implement simpler controls:
		- saturation 
        - brightness
		- redness 
		- master sound compression

### Show and Tell 2
- **second iteration:**
	- still just one video sample
	- more complex controls:
		- beeping (signal processing)
		- flashing (detect intense color changes per pixel above some threshold & blackout?)
		- patterns?

### Final Submission
- **final iteration:**
	- implement user upload capabilities
	- implement preview description





THINK ABOUT EVLAUATION AND HOW WE WILL ANSWER THE RESEARCH QUESTION
TO ADD HCI MEANING
